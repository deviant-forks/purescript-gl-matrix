# purescript-gl-matrix

Purescript wrapper around glmatrix.net

For the glmatrix documention, see [here](http://glmatrix.net/docs/). Note that the purescript version uses immutable types, so no `set` functions are offered, and there is no way to overwrite any datatype. That is, addition of two matrices/vectors always yields a new matrix/vector.
